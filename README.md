# 🚀 30 Days of React & JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my 30-day challenge! This repository contains 30 mini projects built using **React.js**, **JavaScript**, and modern frontend tools. Each project is self-contained and designed to reinforce key concepts like hooks, routing, forms, animations, and component architecture.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- React 19
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- HTML/CSS

## 📁 Folder Structure

All projects are located inside the `src/` directory:


Each folder contains its own `package.json`, `src/`, and `public/` directory, making it easy to run independently.

## 🧪 How to Run a Project Locally

```bash
cd src/app1
npm install
npm run dev
